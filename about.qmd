## About Me 

Hi! I’m Kimberly (or Kimi!), a student at UCLA double majoring in Statistics/Data Science and Economics and minoring in Data Science Engineering. Passionate about data-driven impact, I'm actively exploring opportunities in data science, fintech, crypto, trading and related fields. I have many goals in life but my main one is simply to live an interesting one!
 

After an incredible Summer 2025 internship at Coinbase in NYC, I'm returning as a Sales, Trading & Prime intern in Summer 2026! I love the innovative and collaborative work culture, and I truly enjoy my role scope (it is a bit hard to explain, but think of it as a disruptive-in a good way-intersection of data science, finance, and crypto!). 

When away from the computer, you can find me exploring cafes and restaurants in LA, SF, or NYC! I love matcha and coffee and also run my own food blog, frequently working with small restaurants/cafes and matcha businesses. I'm currently working on a project stemming from my blog (launching December 2025...!) so feel free to stay updated and check out my social "micro micro micro influencer" life @kimicomida on Instagram :)
