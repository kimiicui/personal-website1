Passionate about data-driven impact, I’m actively exploring opportunities in data science, fintech, crypto, trading and related fields. I have many goals in life but my main one is simply to live an interesting one!\nAfter an incredible Summer 2025 internship at Coinbase in NYC, I’m returning as a Sales, Trading & Prime intern in Summer 2026! I love the innovative and collaborative work culture, and I truly enjoy my role scope (it is a bit hard to explain, but think of it as a disruptive-in a good way-intersection of data science, finance, and crypto!).\nWhen away from the computer, you can find me exploring cafes and restaurants in LA, SF, or NYC! I love matcha and coffee and also run my own food blog, frequently working with small restaurants/cafes and matcha businesses. I’m currently working on a project stemming from my blog (launching December 2025…!) so feel free to stay updated and check out my social “micro micro micro influencer” life @kimicomida on Instagram :)\n\n\n\nCoinbase 2025 NYC Institutional Summit"

    "text": "Built an end-to-end recommendation system that curates personalized café suggestions across Los Angeles using real-world Yelp API data. Designed data pipelines to scrape, clean, and structure thousands of reviews, applied sentiment analysis to extract user-experience signals (ambiance, quality, service), and implemented pricing heuristics to balance value and convenience. The tool outputs ranked recommendations optimized for user preferences, with a focus on matcha quality and location efficiency.\nView my project presentation!\n\n\n\nConducted a controlled experimental study to evaluate how caffeine and alcohol impact fine motor performance using a randomized factorial design. Designed and executed a 3×3 two-factor ANOVA experiment comparing beverage type (water, caffeinated sports drink, vodka) and dosage (0, 1, 2 units), with age and gender included as blocking variables to control for demographic variability. Analyzed coordination outcomes from 162 participants using R, performed residual diagnostics to validate model assumptions, and visualized interaction effects through boxplots and interaction plots. Findings revealed no statistically significant effect of drink type or dosage, but a meaningful gender-based difference in coordination variability—highlighting the importance of demographic controls in performance-related research.\n\n\n\nAnalyzed food insecurity trends across Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania using the World Food Programme’s Global Food Prices Database. Investigated how price fluctuations in staple foods (maize, rice, beans) correlated with regional droughts, conflict, and infestations by integrating time-series data with historical event analysis. Built data visualizations to compare cross-country affordability over time and conducted a structured data critique to evaluate limitations in economic representation, purchasing power assumptions, and demographic bias. Findings highlighted climate volatility and political instability as key drivers of food price inflation, with Somalia experiencing the most severe disruptions."
