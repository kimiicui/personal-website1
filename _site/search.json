    "text": "Project 2: Drink Type & Dosage Effects on Motor Coordination (STATS 101B) - June 2025\nConducted a controlled experimental study to evaluate how caffeine and alcohol impact fine motor performance using a randomized factorial design. Designed and executed a 3×3 two-factor ANOVA experiment comparing beverage type (water, caffeinated sports drink, vodka) and dosage (0, 1, 2 units), with age and gender included as blocking variables to control for demographic variability. Analyzed coordination outcomes from 162 participants using R, performed residual diagnostics to validate model assumptions, and visualized interaction effects through boxplots and interaction plots. Findings revealed no statistically significant effect of drink type or dosage, but a meaningful gender-based difference in coordination variability—highlighting the importance of demographic controls in performance-related research."

Investigated how price fluctuations in staple foods (maize, rice, beans) correlated with regional droughts, conflict, and infestations by integrating time-series data with historical event analysis. Built data visualizations to compare cross-country affordability over time and conducted a structured data critique to evaluate limitations in economic representation, purchasing power assumptions, and demographic bias. Findings highlighted climate volatility and political instability as key drivers of food price inflation, with Somalia experiencing the most severe disruptions."
